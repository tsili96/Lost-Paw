## Project Structure

The project follows a clean ASP.NET Core MVC architecture with clearly separated concerns:

- Controllers: 
Handles HTTP requests and returns views or data. Each controller corresponds to a major feature (e.g., PostsController, AccountController, ChatController).

- Models: 
Core domain entities such as User, Post, Pet, etc.

- ViewModels:
Data transfer objects (DTOs) used to pass structured data from controllers to views, keeping models clean.

- Views:
Razor .cshtml files organized into folders by feature (e.g., Posts, Account, Chat, Shared). These define what the user sees.

- Data:
Contains the Entity Framework Core database context and related configurations:

- Migrations: Auto-generated EF migration files

- EntityTypeConfigurations: Fluent API classes used to configure entity relationships and constraints

- Hubs: 
SignalR hubs for real-time messaging features.

- Services: 
Custom service classes that contain business logic (e.g., chat services, location services).

- wwwroot:
Static assets like CSS, JavaScript, images, and third-party libraries.

- appsettings.json:
Stores configuration such as database connection strings and external API settings.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Do not commit sensitive values like your Google Maps API key to version control.
